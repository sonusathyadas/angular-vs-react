# Angular vs React.JS
---
### Angular
Angular is a TypeScript based Web development framework for Single Page Applications. Angular is an open-source web framework maintained by **Google**. Initialy Google came with a library for developing Single Page Applications called AngularJS. Later, the same team worked on a different project that released as a development framework for SPA applications. It is named as Angular. Angular JS uses JavaScript to develop web UI applications. But, Angular uses TypeScript to develop SPA applications that helps developers to create type-safe and ES6 based JavaScript applications. 
Angular is a web UI development framework not a library. A libary offers just a collection of functions that can be called from any web application.
#### Angular offers the following features:
1) Angular CLI.  
    Angular providers a command line tool to create, test, run and build project. This CLI tool provides a rich set of commands that can also be used to generate your Angular components, services, directives, pipes, modules, classes and more. Use the CLI command to run the project in watch mode during development. You can also run the test files using CLI command. A single CLI command can also produce code that can be deployed in your web server.
2) Open-source and cross-platform development 
3) MVC Architecture
4) Performance and fast view rendering.
5) TypeScript for development.
6) Built-in Dependency Injection (DI) support.
7) Event handling and Two-way data binding support.
8) Built-in form validation and error handling.
9) Enahanced and simple routing 
    a) Lazy loading
    b) Route guards
    c) Data resolvers
support.
10) Component Development Kit (CDK) and support for Angular Material
11) Virtual scrolling 
12) Differential loading

### React
ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building fast rendering User Interfaces for you web applications. ReactJS library is developed and maintained by **Facebook**. React uses *JSX* for developing the UI components.  It is declarative, open-source and cross-platform library that uses a concept called *Virtual DOM* for developing fast rendering UI elements.   

#### Features of ReactJS
1) Open-source and cross-platform support.
2) CLI tool to start with quick start templates.
3) Virtual DOM support.
4) One-way data binding
4) Easy integration with other web frameworks.
5) Ideal for mobile app development.
6) Rich set of libraries
    a) routing
    b) state management
    c) theming
7) Better community support
