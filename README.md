# Angular vs React.JS
---
### Angular
Angular is a TypeScript based Web development framework for Single Page Applications. Angular is an open-source web framework maintained by **Google**. Initialy Google came with a library for developing Single Page Applications called AngularJS. Later, the same team worked on a different project that released as a development framework for SPA applications. It is named as Angular. Angular JS uses JavaScript to develop web UI applications. But, Angular uses TypeScript to develop SPA applications that helps developers to create type-safe and ES6 based JavaScript applications. 
Angular is a web UI development framework not a library. A libary offers just a collection of functions that can be called from any web application.
#### Angular offers the following features:
1) **Angular CLI**  
    Angular providers a command line tool to create, test, run and build project. This CLI tool provides a rich set of commands that can also be used to generate your Angular components, services, directives, pipes, modules, classes and more. Use the CLI command to run the project in watch mode during development. You can also run the test files using CLI command. A single CLI command can also produce code that can be deployed in your web server.
2) **Open-source and cross-platform development**  
    Angular is an open-source web framework for developing Single Page Applications. It provides cross-platform support, so you can develop your web application from and OS using your favorite IDEs such as VS code, Atom, JetBrains WebStorm, NetBeans, IntelliJ IDEA etc.
3) **MVC or MVVM Architecture**  
    MVC refers to Model-View-Controller and MVVM refers to Model-View-ViewModel. You can develop you application in MVC or MVVM architecture using Angular. Angular allows you to create reusable components. A component provides and HTML view and code file. The code file contains the event handling code and other functions. The HTML file contains the markup and Angular directives and pipes. You can also create injectable services for reusable code logic.
4) **Performance and fast view rendering**  
    Next version of Angular framework will come with a new compilation and rendering engine. This next generation rendering engine is named as **Ivy**.  With the version 9 release of Angular, the new compiler and runtime instructions are used by default instead of the older compiler and runtime, known as View Engine.
5) **TypeScript for development**  
    Angular uses **TypeScript** as the default language for development. It helps developers to use the ES6 features in your application. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that provides compile-time error checking. The type-safe TypeScript language increases the productivity of developers by helping them to generate error-free code.
6) **Built-in Dependency Injection (DI) support**  
    To increase the efficiency and modularity of your application you can create reusable service classes in Angular. These service classes can be injected in to any component, directive, pipe or other services using Dependency Injection. Angular uses its own DI framework to handle it. With DI application manages the number of instances, scope and life time of your service objects.
7) **Event handling and Two-way data binding support**  
    Angular offers built-in two-way data binding which helps us to bind the objects to form controls. Angular also also provides event-handling functionality that helps to invoke function on various events of the UI elements. 
8) **Built-in form validation and error handling** 
    Angular provides two ways for creating and managin forms- Template Driven and Reactive. The template driven using the *FormsModule* and directives such as *ngModel* and *ngForm*. Reactive forms uses *ReactiveFormsModule* and directives and services suchas *FormGroup*, *FormControl*, *Validators*, *FormBuilder* etc.
9) **Enahanced and simple routing**  
    Angular uses built-in routing module that uses the HTML 5 routing paths. You can use route parameters and query parameters to the routes. Angular uses the *RouterModule* to enable routing in your applciation. Angular routing also offers the following features:  
    * Lazy loading  
    * Route guards  
    * Data resolvers  
    * Http Interceptors
10) **Component Development Kit (CDK) and support for Angular Material**  
    The Component Dev Kit (CDK) is a set of tools that implement common interaction patterns whilst being unopinionated about their presentation. Angular CDK provides a feature called *Virtual Scrolling* that loads only a set of data that fits the screen. When you scroll down it loads the data dynamically and load into the page component. The latest version of Angular provides support for Material themes using Angular Material that is used as the backbone of the Angular CDK.
11) **Differential loading**    
    Angular 8 comes with a new feature called *Differential loading*. Using this Angular CLI can now generate two separate bundles of project output, one for the legacy JavaScript (ES5) and another one for modern JavaScript (ES6 and later).

### React
ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building fast rendering User Interfaces for you web applications. ReactJS library is developed and maintained by **Facebook**. React uses *JSX* for developing the UI components.  It is declarative, open-source and cross-platform library that uses a concept called *Virtual DOM* for developing fast rendering UI elements.   

#### Features of ReactJS
1) Open-source and cross-platform support.
2) CLI tool to start with quick start templates.
3) Virtual DOM support.
4) One-way data binding
4) Easy integration with other web frameworks.
5) Ideal for mobile app development.
6) Rich set of libraries
    a) routing
    b) state management
    c) theming
7) Better community support
